This is an industrial automation based application. It shows the concept of normal conveyor belt, but with some intelligence. We can also call it as intelligent conveyor belt, as it has also ability to sort the object of different sizes.

This helps to avoid size malfunctioning in production machines. In the core of the project, Embedded System (NodeMCU) and Internet of Things technology have been used. The NodeMCU is brain of the system and controls the relay and drives servo motor according to input from size sorting sensors.

IR rays in photodiode are used for detection. The objects of different sizes are passed through the sensors and the object having specified size is sorted. The belt is driven by drive circuit which is controlled by Push button.

The internet of things technology provides the monitoring of the process and person can observe the count on smart phone. By developing such sorting system the production rate of the manufacturing industry has been increased since these sorting systems replaced the human resources.
