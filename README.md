# Industrial Size Sorter and Production Counter using IOT

It is an industrial automation based application,It has an ability to sort the products of different sizes and update the count of the products manfactured at the particular interval of time on the internet.

It uses Embedded System (NodeMCU) and Internet of Things technology so user has the beifit of using it from anywhere.

# Pre-Requisites:
      1.Node MCU
      2.BLYNK app
      3.Aurduino Software IDE
      4.ServoMoter
      5.IR sensors
  
Download the circuit diagram, Make the connections as per the circuit diagram given in the repository after completing the connections.

Download the source code and make thes changes in the source code
            1)update the char auth[] with your authentication key of blynk account
            2)update ssid and pass with your WiFi credentials
Now save the code and dump the code to NodeMCU using Aurduino IDE.

Now open the blynk app from your mobile and start controlling the project, The internet of things technology provides the monitoring of the process and person can observe the count on smart phone. 
By developing such sorting system the production rate of the manufacturing industry has been increased since these sorting systems replaced the human resources.
